that worked, thanks.

In regards to my interest in putting a survey link into the Appointment Follow-Up email... I tried creating a link:

https://form.jotform.com/202755563531051?sessionInfo=[MeetingUrl]

... but it looks like Flexbooker redirects that URL literally, i.e. rather than substitute the value of [MeetingUrl],
